# Introduction to Python Programming
A short, easy, low-stakes introduction to Python programming

## Installation
If you have not yet installed Anaconda for the computer you will be using, please download from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and install

After installing, make yourself an easy way to get to the included IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Spider

Class content can be found [here](https://github.com/dcknuth/teach_yourself_python) if you need to copy/paste something

If it is taking a long time to install Anaconda, use [this](https://www.online-python.com/) until it is complete

## Why Python?
* Python is currently the most used programming language on earth
  - [See how it goes](https://youtu.be/G-0kiQImaV8?t=168) from around the time you were born
* Python is pretty easy
  - Useful with just a bit of training
* Python probably has a module that does most of what you want
  - From useful: NumPy (arrays), Pandas (data analysis) and containers (data container sets)
  - To specific: celmech (celestial mechanics)
  - To entertaining: art and freegames
* Installed by default on all of today’s major operating systems
  - Windows, Mac and Linux
  - There is Circuit Python for some small boards (Pi Pico W)
* Is often the scripting language for other tools
  - Blender's scripting language is Python!

## What We Will Cover
* Spyder (Python IDE)
  - We will learn just enough about Spyder to use it as our place to create Python programs
* Most of what is in the first 11 chapters of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  - It’s a free, on-line book, so you can revisit it or do parts we skip with ease
* From chapters 12 - 20 we will only do things that:
  - Fit nicely to a class setting
  - Are not repetitive (only CSV files and not also Google and Excel sheets)
  - Are interesting, we can only cover so much
* You choose the last Friday
  - We will put together a list of topics to choose from and the class will vote on what to cover

## How We Will Work
* Try everything as we go (this is the last slide of the class)
* Type in almost everything
  - It helps to learn and remember
* Any Q&A will be via polling
  - I will ask a random person directly
* Two break times about about thirds, <10 min
  - Good time for catch-up or fixes
* Each lesson is independent and can be done without the others
  - Lesson 2 does NOT need lesson 1 to be completed
* We will solve >=1 random programming question at the end of each class
  - This is to give you a way to get practice after the class is done
  - No grades, no right answer, no need to finish, ask your favorite AI, OK to cheat, no worries
* Targeting personal projects and growth, not a grade or certification
