# Teach Yourself Python
I started these as a way to teach my daughter Python, but continued to put them together long after she lost interest. I almost taught a class using them and may try again soon.

## Introduction
These lessons were developed with the [Anaconda installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) using Spider Python. You should be able to use whatever Python interpreter you like best, but the follow-along parts will target the Spider IDE. The first few lessons are modeled after the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). I changed things to be relevant to my daughter and added or removed things where I thought it was needed or to work with my Python version, but Al Sweigart’s work is pretty great. I also liked his [Cracking Codes with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/).
